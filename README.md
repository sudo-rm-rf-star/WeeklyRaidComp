# WeeklyRaidComp

This is a personal project of a long-time WoW player who was tired of the manual task of creating a raid composition on a weekly basis.
There were a lot of useful features lacking for me in the existing tooling, so I decided to create a bot for raid management.

## Features
- Send automatic PMs to players when new raids are created
- Create rosters automatically based on a set of heuristics designed for each raid tier
- Integration with Warcraft Logs to make smart decisions based on the signups for your raid
- Show statistics for your raiders and your raids
- And much more...
